# Progress log

Running checklist of what exists and what doesn't. Newest log entries at the bottom.
`[x]` done · `[~]` partial (see note) · `[ ]` not started.

## Checklist

### Pipeline (tools/extract.py → public/gen/)
- [x] Maps + layouts (blocks, border, connections, events)
- [x] Tilesets: one atlas per primary, one per (primary, secondary) pair + overrides; attributes per tileset
- [x] Overworld sprites (object event pic tables + palettes)
- [x] Constants: metatile behaviors, new-game hidden-object flags
- [x] Fonts (latin normal/male/female/small) + glyph widths + font metrics
- [x] Charmap (for encoding decomp strings exactly as preproc does)
- [x] Text strings (all `.string` labels reachable from event_scripts.s)
- [x] Dialogue window frame graphics + palette, down-arrow indicator
- [x] Scripts (event_scripts.s + all includes → instruction streams with labels; macros defined in script files expanded)
- [x] Numeric constants (`#define`s incl. simple expressions, event macro symbols, std script table)
- [x] NPC text colours per graphics id (sTextColorTable)
- [x] C strings from src/strings.c (menu labels etc.)
- [x] Std window frames (type1..10, palette from each PNG); menu cursor is the ▶ font glyph
- [ ] Tile animations (water, flowers, etc.)
- [ ] Door animation graphics
- [ ] Field effect graphics (grass, shadows, emotes, ...)
- [ ] Species / moves / items / trainers / wild encounters data
- [ ] Battle graphics (mon front/back sprites, backgrounds, interface)
- [ ] Audio

### Engine
- [x] Map rendering (below/above layers), connections, border
- [x] Grid movement: walk, run, tap-to-turn, ledges
- [x] Collision: collision bits, elevation rules, directional impassable, objects
- [x] Warps: doors (+ walk out), arrow/stair warps, step warps
- [x] NPC movement types (wander, look around, face, pace)
- [x] Hidden objects via flags
- [x] Object spawning: all of a map's sprites preloaded on entry, synchronous `addobject`, in-view spawning as the camera moves (TrySpawnObjectEvents)
- [ ] Despawning objects that leave the view (RemoveObjectEventsOutsideView)
- [x] `LOCALID_*` names resolved per map from map.json `local_id`
- [x] Input module with all GBA buttons (A, B, Start, Select, L, R), sampled per logic tick
- [x] Text engine: port of RenderText (speed + A/B speed-up, all FC control codes, \n \l \p, placeholders)
- [x] Message box (dialogue frame, down-arrow indicator)
- [~] Game state: flags, vars, names, text speed (in memory only; names are placeholders until naming screen)
- [~] Script interpreter: flow/branching, flags/vars, msgbox via std scripts, text colour, movements, object add/remove/move, setmetatile, warps, delay. Unimplemented commands log once to the console
- [x] NPC talk (incl. across counters) / signs / coord triggers / map scripts (on transition, on frame, on load, on warp-into)
- [x] NPC text colours by gender
- [x] YES/NO box (sYesNo_WindowTemplate, 5-frame input delay, B = NO)

- [ ] Map name popup
- [ ] Save/load
- [ ] Bag, party, summary, Pokédex, options
- [ ] Wild encounters, trainer sight
- [ ] Battle engine
- [ ] Audio playback
- [ ] Title screen / intro / Oak's speech / naming

## Where to resume

State as of the last log entry:
- **Playable:** new game in Player's House 2F → walk around Pallet Town / Route 1 → talk to NPCs, read signs →
  trigger Oak at the top of Pallet Town → walk to the lab → the starter-selection dialogue.
- **Stops at:** receiving a starter. The lab scripts need (counts from the reachable code):
  `special`/`specialvar` (~14), `buffernumberstring`/`bufferspeciesname`, `showmonpic`/`hidemonpic`, `givemon`,
  `giveitem_msg`/`checkitem`/`removeitem`, `fadescreen`, `famechecker`, `trainerbattle_earlyrival`.
- **Suggested next milestone:** save-data model (party, bag) + species/items extraction → `givemon`, item commands,
  buffer commands, the common specials, `showmonpic` → then the battle engine for the rival fight.
- **How to find what a script needs:** unimplemented script commands log once to the browser console as
  `[script] unimplemented command ...`.
- **Workflow used so far:** read the C in the decomp, port it, cite the function name, verify in headless Chrome with
  `tools/browser-test.mjs`, then add an entry below.

## Log

### Milestone 1: overworld
- Vite + TS + Phaser 3 scaffold; extractor for maps, tilesets, sprites.
- Walkable overworld with connections, warps, ledges, NPCs. Verified Player's House 2F → 1F → Pallet Town → Route 1.

### Tileset de-duplication
- Atlases split into per-primary + per-pair (with palette-dependent "override" metatiles). 3.6 MB → 1.2 MB.
  Verified pixel-identical to the old per-pair render for all 60 pairs.

### Text engine + scripts
- Input module: A=Z/Space, B=X, Start=Enter, Select=Backspace, L=A, R=S, D-pad=arrows (WASD dropped).
- Extracted fonts, charmap, strings, dialogue frame, script instruction streams, constants.
- Text printer ported from `RenderText`; message box from `field_message_box.c` / `WindowFunc_DrawDialogueFrame`.
- Script interpreter runs the decomp's own scripts at macro level; `msgbox` goes through the decomp's std scripts.
- Verified: signs, NPC dialogue across multiple pages, female NPC red text, dialogue closes and returns control.
- Fixed: the A press that closes a message could re-trigger the interaction in the same frame
  (field input now only runs if no script was active at the start of the frame, as on the GBA).

### Menus
- Std-framed windows (`MenuWindow`), generic cursor menu (`Menu`), YES/NO box, start menu shell.
- `yesnobox` now shows the real menu; verified YES → 1, NO → 0, B → 0 via `Std_MsgboxYesNo`.
- Fixed: an overlay handing off to another (start menu → notice) was immediately cleared.

### Oak sequence fixes (user report)
- A + held direction: A is now checked before movement (ProcessPlayerFieldInput order), so you can talk while still holding a direction.
- `LOCALID_*` names weren't resolved (they're generated per map from map.json `local_id`), so `addobject`/`applymovement` on NPCs targeted nothing → Oak never appeared. Now resolved per map; unknown ids warn.
- `addobject` spawned asynchronously (sprite still loading). All of a map's object sprites are now preloaded on map entry and spawning is synchronous.
- Player stayed invisible after `set_invisible` + warp. Warps now reset player visibility (the GBA recreates the player object).
- Extractor now expands assembler macros defined inside script files (e.g. movement macros in PalletTown/scripts.inc).
- Door animation commands stubbed (no animation yet).
- Verified: trigger → Oak appears → leads player to lab → lab scene with rival plays out.
- Blocking the rest of the lab (starter choice + rival battle): `special`/`specialvar` (10+), buffer commands,
  `showmonpic`/`hidemonpic`, `givemon` (needs party/species data), `giveitem_msg`/`checkitem`/`removeitem` (bag),
  `fadescreen`, `famechecker`, `trainerbattle_earlyrival` (battle engine).

### Oak trigger off-by-one (user report)
- Symptom: 1-tile gap between Oak and player; player walked over the lab's bottom row on the way to the door.
- Cause: holding Up onto the trigger tile. The coord trigger started the script on arrival, but field input for that
  same frame had already been allowed, so the player took one extra step north. All scripted player moves are
  relative, so everything after was shifted by a row.
- Fix: re-check script/overlay state after arrival before processing movement (matches ProcessPlayerFieldInput
  returning after TryStartCoordEventScript).
- Verified for both triggers, holding Up: player stays on (12,1)/(13,1), Oak stops at (12,2)/(13,2), player ends at
  (15,14) and Oak at (16,14), both enter the door at (16,13), and the lab scene starts.

### Missing Oak in the lab (user report)
- The lab scene does `removeobject` (sets FLAG_HIDE_OAK_IN_HIS_LAB) → `setobjectxyperm 6,3` → `clearflag`, with no
  `addobject`. On the GBA, Oak comes back because `TrySpawnObjectEvents` runs every time the camera moves a tile and
  spawns any unspawned template in view whose hide flag is clear.
- Implemented that view-window spawn check (player-relative x −9..+10, y −7..+9, from MAP_OFFSET bounds), run after
  every completed player step, scripted or not.
- Verified: Oak walks up, is removed, and reappears at (6,3) as soon as the player takes a step.
- Not yet: RemoveObjectEventsOutsideView (despawning objects that leave the view). Harmless for now.
